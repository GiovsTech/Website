### LinuxEFIMounter

LinuxEFIMounter is a simple and standalone Bash program that makes it easy to mount the EFI partition on your Hackintosh drive directly from Linux. It could be used to mount any EFI partition (also Windows and Linux ones) from a Linux environment, but its main purpose is to let you mount your Hackintosh EFI partition without having to boot it. [Download it](https://tools.gianstech.it/docs/download-lem).
