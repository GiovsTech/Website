### Foreword

GiovsTech's a young developer of 15 years old, who loves the world of technology and computer science, but <u>Science</u> too. Indeed, he has learned the most powerful programming languages, for example, Python, HTML, CSS and PHP.  

Beyond the world of technology, he loves reading books about philosophy, science, history, and installing operative systems. 

The last time he set up his computer, he installed Arch Linux in dual boot with Windows. 

He founded a project, called "Hazen Tech", too. It was a "company" with three employees [GiovsTechs](https://gthz.it/lkg), [SincererFlame71](https://sincererflame71.it), [FranzaGeek](https://www.youtube.com/@FranzaGeek).

### Story of Hazen Tech Project

To understand the story behind "The Hazen Tech Project", I must tell ideas which made the ideology of the project.  

It was created in June 2021, when I learned how to make websites in HTML and CSS. After that, I met SincerFlame71 and FranzaGeek, my friends, in telegram Communities.

When it was founded, the name of our "company" was "Ilooh Technology" but, in the summer of 2022, we've changed the name in "Hazen 3e Technologies".

Our company made open source software, sharing "Open Source Ideology", owned by Richard Stallman.

On the 23rd June 2023, "The Hazen Project" was closed, because the team doesn't do anything to support it. You can visit [Hazen's inactive website](https://inactive.hazentech.it) to understand how things are changed.

### Hobby: Reading

Yes, I like reading books! In this century, reading isn’t a "popular" thing to love, but I don’t care. Anyway, the best book I read until this moment was ***1984***, written by *George Orwell*. It's amazing book that is about the dictatorships in 1900, which controlled people and theirs opinion.

“Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two equals four. Granted that, everything else follows naturally.“

Books that I read:

1. Animal Farm, by Orwell

2. 1984, by Orwell

3. Il Matematico Impertinente , by Piergiorgio Odifreddi

4. Viva il Latino , by Nicola Gardini

5. HTML AND CSS: Guide

6. Il Detenuto Zero, by Yiannis Karvelis

7. Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley

8. Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell

9. Il Ventre di Napoli, Matilde Serao 

10. La variante di Lunebürg, Paolo Maurensig
   

   and others...
