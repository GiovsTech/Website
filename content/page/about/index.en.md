### The Story of Hazen Tech Project

For understand the story under "The Hazen Tech Project" , I must tell you my ideas that       have created the ideology of the project.  

In Fact, it was created in Summer 2021 ( June 2021), when I learned how create websites in HTML and CSS. After that, I met my friends in Telegram Communities, in particulary, Stockdroid 's Group, where I met SincererFlame71 and after, FranzaGeek. 

Early, the name of our "Company" was "Ilooh Technology", but in the summer of 2022, We ' ve changed the name in "Hazen 3e Technologies".

Our Company creates open source softwares, sharing the "Open Source's Ideology", owned by Richard Stallman and his [FSF](https://fsf.org).  In Fact, We have created a telegram bot for control our Telegram Group, where our followers understand our ideas, sharing theirs opinions. Another project 's a Video Downloader, coded in Python, for download videos from Youtube, but now It isn't available. In conclusion, We 've also created a Android App for administrate daily tasks , also called "To Do List".

### Online Friends that I met

I have always been withdrawn boy, so , I haven't did many friends in the real world. In fact, a fracture to my way of being has been meeting online friends that I can trust. Firstly, I have met SincererFlame71 or "Pierluigi", one of my friends, that changed my life. He introduced me other people , like "FasmanTaylor", a girl, my girlfriend :). Secondly, I met  FranzaGeek, young developer, that together with him and SincererFlame71, We founded our Company.

My Story is so strange, but I'm proud of it :). I want to give thanks to my friends: **<u>SincererFlame71, FasmanTaylor, FranzaGeek and ScaraBoobs</u>**.

Thanks!

### Hobby: Reading

Yes, I like reading books! In this century, Reading isn’t a popular thing to love, but I don’t follow other people, I hate concept of mass and to follow it. Indeed, I don’t want to be like the others be. The best book I read was ***1984***, written by *George Orwell*. It 's amazing book, that is about the dictatorships in 1900, which controlled the people and theirs opinion.

“Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two equals four. Granted that, everything else follows naturally.“

Books That I Read:

1. Animal Farm, by Orwell

2. 1984, by Orwell

3. Il Matematico Impertinente , by Piergiorgio Odifreddi

4. Viva il Latino , by Nicola Gardini

5. HTML AND CSS: Guide

6. Il Detenuto Zero, by Yiannis Karvelis
   
   and others...
